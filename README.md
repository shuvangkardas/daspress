* **Git Publishing**: Automatically commits and pushes to your Git repository
* **Smart Paths**: Supports Obsidian file paths and standard filenames
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

---

## Commands

```bash
python -m daspress setup                 # Interactive configuration wizard  
python -m daspress convert "post.md"     # Convert post to Jekyll format  
python -m daspress local "post.md"       # Convert and start local Jekyll server  
python -m daspress remote "post.md"      # Convert and publish to Git repository  
python -m daspress both "post.md"        # Convert, preview locally, and publish
```

---

## Setup Requirements

1. An Obsidian vault with your blog posts
2. A Jekyll blog repository
3. Git installed and configured for the Jekyll repository
4. Ruby and Jekyll installed for running the local server

---

## Obsidian Integration

1. Run `daspress setup` from the command line
2. Configure the Obsidian Shell Commands plugin

**Shell Command**:

```bash
python -m daspress remote "{{file_path:absolute}}"
```

3. Ensure Git is installed and local publishing works
4. Add the command as a named action

**Suggested name**: `Publish Blog Post`

Now you can publish directly from Obsidian with a single click.

---

## How It Works

1. Reads your Obsidian markdown files
2. Converts image links like `![[image.png]]` to Jekyll-compatible syntax
3. Copies images from the Obsidian vault to the Jekyll assets folder
4. Saves the converted post in the Jekyll `_posts` directory
5. Optionally starts a local server and/or publishes to Git

---

## Configuration

Run:

```bash
daspress setup
```

This configures:

* Obsidian posts folder path
* Obsidian images folder path
* Jekyll blog root directory

Configuration is saved at `~/.daspress/config.yaml`

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues, use debug mode to identify errors:

```bash
daspress --debug convert "post.md"
```
