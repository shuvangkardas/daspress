I started building my second brain in 2021, during my first year as a PhD student. Since then, Iâ€™ve taken over 6,000 notes in Obsidian.

Last month, I began turning parts of my notes into blog posts. Now, I hit a small milestoneâ€”my 70th published blog! Goal is to go to 500 blogs at the end of the year. 

What makes me most excited is that writing and publishing no longer feels like a chore. Iâ€™ve created a system (pipeline) that makes it frictionless.

Once I polish the draft (30 minutes) in markdown, I hit a button in Obsidianâ€”and within 10 seconds, my blog goes live.

This setup was inspired by Atomic Habits â€”if you want to build a habit, reduce friction. Thatâ€™s exactly what I did.

### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m **Shuvangkar Das**, a power systems researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University. I work at the intersection of power electronics, DER, IBR, and AI â€” building greener, smarter, and more stable grids. Currently, Iâ€™m a Research Engineer at EPRI (though everything I share here reflects my personal experience, not my employerâ€™s views).

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving large scale EMT simulation and firmware development for  grid-forming and grid following inverter and reinforcement learning (RL). I also publish technical content and share hands-on insights with the goal of making complex ideas accessible to engineers and researchers.
